# ES6

## `let`, `const` & `var`

- `var` is function scope, meaning leakage
- `let` and `const` are block scoped
- Goodbye IFFE, hello `{let thing = 22}`
- `const` cannot be redefined
- Use `const` by default
- `let` and `const` define intention
- No more temporal d(e)adspace, cannot call a variable before it has value
