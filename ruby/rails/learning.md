# Ruby on Rails

## Module-View-Controller (MVC)

- Separation between data and the code used to display that data
- Browser sends a request, server passes this to the controller. Controller
renders a view or interacts with a model that communicates with the database.
Then the view can be rendered.

## REpresentational State Transfer (REST)

- Application components (like 'tweets') modelled as resources that can be
created, read, updated and deleted (CRUD operations of relational databases).

---

- Common to use symbols as hash keys rather than strings
