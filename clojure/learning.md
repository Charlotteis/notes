# Notes

- Clojure is both:
  - a compiler
  - a language
- Clojure is a _hosted language_, wherein it gets compiled into Java
- Leiningen is the defacto Clojure tool, helping you to build and run
  Clojure projects

- Prefix notiation: the operator always comes first in an expression
  - `(+ 1 2 3 4)` instead of `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4)`
- `[1 2 3 4]` is a vector (1 dimensional array)
